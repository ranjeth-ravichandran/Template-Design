# Template for Web-Development
I am creating a template to follow for aesthetics for web-development, to one streamline my process for creating projects for web applications, and two to create a stylized project which I can follow for future projects as this theme can stay consistent to show off my personal traits.

## Font
For the font I will use the [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) <span style="color:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px;">'Chewy' & 'Patrick'</span>. The usage is shown bellow in css.
```css
/* Headings */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Chewy&display=swap');

p {
    font-family: "Chewy", system-ui;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}

/* Normal Text */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Patrick+Hand&display=swap');

p {
    font-family: "Patrick Hand", cursive;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}

```

## Colors
When creating a project think about the design process and what colors will be used through out the application, as a template pick maximum of 8 colors which may be used through-out the application.
```css
